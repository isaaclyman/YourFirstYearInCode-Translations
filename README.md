# YourFirstYearInCode-Translations

Unofficial, reader-submitted translations of Your First Year in Code.

Feel free to submit PRs translating or correcting one or more chapters in any language. 
Every attempt will be made to find someone who speaks the same language to review and accept your PR.

For new translations, please create a folder at the project root. The name should be a language and region shortcode (e.g. _pt-br_ or _es-mx_).

The _en-us_ version is the original, canonical version of the book and does not accept PRs in this repo.

Thank you so much for helping this book to reach a wider audience!

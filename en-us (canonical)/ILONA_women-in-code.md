# Women in code

_Ilona Codes_
 
### Introduction

I got my first PC when I was 11 years old and it became everything to me. I remember that "after computer" time when the real world didn't seem as interesting anymore. Like many children, I started spending hours playing video games, and with an internet connection, I went deeper into the flow of information and ideas.

As the years went by my interest in computers and computer science only increased. This played the main role in my career choice and selection of my university major. I was facing a choice between computer science and medicine. I couldn't decide what was more interesting to me. And as you've guessed by now, I made the decision to pursue computer science.

Early in my career I remember thinking, "maybe this was a bad decision." I tried to give up twice in my first year in the IT industry. There were many reasons and people around me at the time that made me strongly consider that. And I'm far from the only one who tried to quit the industry.

So, why do women turn away from technology careers?

Because there are spoken and unspoken barriers that make it difficult for women to advance in IT.

Talking to women in tech and code at different events, I've observed some common problems which have forced women to leave engineering careers:

- Poor working conditions: too much travel, lack of advancement, low salary, etc. 
- Lack of respect for women in male-dominated fields.
- Unhealthy workplace climate: closed-minded managers, dev teams that are difficult to work with, or lousy company culture.

To boil it down to the most universal problem, we see that *bias* pushes women out of the industry. Moreover, that bias can play out even worse depending on a woman's race or ethnicity.

Nowadays coding is becoming one of the most in-demand skills across industries, and the milestones I'll discuss here will help you to "overcome" your first year in code if you are a woman. Because, honestly, being a software engineer is one of the best jobs for women. We implement products and make life easier for people who use them. Sometimes I feel like a hero doing it. Isn't that amazing?

But because of that *bias*, you can miss out on all the benefits of a programming career. Here's a list of the advantages of being a software engineer at the company where I currently work:

- We work five days a week. We have a flexible schedule and can even work from home.
- We learn new things constantly while solving problems, working with other software engineers, watching webinars, doing courses, visiting conferences, etc.
- We celebrate all occasions with our teams. We go to team parties and do team-building exercises.
- We make friends from different countries and cultures, and they enrich our life experience.
- We can easily switch from client to client or product to product. If we don't find our work challenging, we can change the type of work that we do.

It's not my first job, but so far it is my best one.

### Choosing a company with the right values

Only now do I understand that when I was looking for my first job and sent out lots of applications for entry-level frontend positions, I didn't pay enough attention to the companies I was applying to.

I didn't even clearly understand the differences between types of companies: a startup? A consultancy? An agency? A public company? A product company?

I knew HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. And I had made fancy web pages and implemented mini projects to consolidate my technology stack knowledge and create a portfolio. My only focus was on getting professional experience---and finding my first job.

As a result, out of 20-30 CVs sent to different companies, I got 2-3 invitations to interviews. I didn't much care about what kind of company they were with, what products/services the company provided, the company's values or the team lead/manager I was going to work with. And that was a big mistake on my part. If I had known better, my first job could have been at a company I'd be happy to work at.

You can always get insights about a company before applying for a position. For example, through the company's reviews on job search websites. You can meet current and former employees at meetups or other events and get more details about the company's purpose or vision or whether the company has open positions at the moment. 

Then Google the name of the company and check their job postings. After getting enough information, you can understand whether the company is diversity-friendly and worth applying at, how the company is organized, what the working process would be like for you there, etc.

Different types of software engineering jobs demand different kinds of preparation. If you've done your research and decided which company you would like to join, then start by sharpening your skills and focusing on your strengths and weaknesses. Do some side projects to learn the required tech stack for the position. Add all these to your resume and send it to the company. 

If it's your first year in code, I would suggest you apply at startups and mid-size companies. These companies are full of hands-on work. You'll get good exposure to things to learn and, more importantly, your ideas and suggestions will be taken into consideration. You'll be able to challenge yourself, showcase your creativity and learn how to work on a team. These jobs can give you a clearer picture of yourself regarding what skills and knowledge you need to get. Also, you'll get the chance to build your professional network.

### The importance of telling the truth

As women in tech, we always face more problems at work than men. This observation comes not only from my life experience but also from my women friends and acquaintances who work in IT. I am lucky now to be working in a healthy environment, and along with a professional relationship with management, we are building trust between the two sides: employer and employee.

Once, when I was visiting a meetup for women who code, I met Clara (name has been changed). She is a junior software engineer at company X.
 
At that time she was a new employee. And you know how it's difficult to adapt to company processes, a new project, and your coworkers in your first weeks or even months, especially if it's your first year in the field.

Later I texted her to invite her to meet up for a cup of coffee. I wanted to hear her story. While we were sitting in the cafe, drinking coffee and speaking about our jobs, Clara confessed that she was afraid of saying "I don't know" when in fact she didn't know something. Instead of that, she was trying to bluff her way through the situation and not lose control.

Her apparent reason was fear of looking stupid in front of her colleagues and managers at work. She's a competent professional and she must have an answer because it's her job, isn't it?

A year ago, I would have answered "Yes." It is my job. And I must know the answer to any question related to my expertise. But not now.

It took years for me to understand that when you are telling the truth, you can breathe easier. It's a straightforward and selfish reason, one I truly learned through my experience. There are many pros to the truth: you don't need to focus on backstories, and backstories of backstories, and relevant details to make what you're saying appear plausible, and making your body language match up with what you are saying.

When you are telling the truth, you are at peace; you are honest. So much less energy needs to be spent.

Don't be afraid of telling your team or manager that you cannot finish your work on time. I'm sure you had reasons, perhaps a specific problem or blocker. The best solution is to provide an explanation and make your case as to why you couldn't finish this task as planned.

If you are blocked by a problem and cannot find a workaround, don't hesitate to ask for help. An answer or some useful advice from a colleague or team member can easily unblock you and allow you to continue solving your problem. And it will help you solve the same problem in the future if it arises again.

In the end, you will only benefit from gaining new knowledge, learning how to work as a team, and spending less time on figuring out a solution.

Some people think that having a gap in knowledge is a weakness. But the real weakness is being close-minded and dishonest.

### How to grow a thick skin and handle complexities
 
During my university studies I noticed that most of the students were men. Even at that time I could imagine how my future working environment would look. And I was right.

During my first year in code I worked with men as the only woman on my team, and to be honest, at that startup, it was hard to work together, not just for me but also for my teammates.

There was that bias against accepting code produced by me---by a woman.

Yes, women are different from men. And yes, women can definitely code. But many have stopped coding because someone once made them feel like they can't code _well_.

Looking back on that time, maybe you're a beginner without any practical working experience at all, still confused about processes, teamwork and code bases with tens or hundreds of thousands of lines of code. The combination of unknown things, complexity, and a new team where you're only an intern surrounded by middle-level/senior software developers---it can make you feel as though there's a massive amount of pressure on you.

In the beginning, it was a significant challenge to go to work. But I did it, even if I was crying. I understood the importance of it. I was trying to see things positively and benefit from them by:

- Learning from my failures
- Distinguishing between personal and business
- Trying to get constructive feedback from the team
- Not complaining about things

For the time being I worked with men, learned from them, and built stamina. And I saw how easily some men separate personal and business. They can be fighting with each other about a topic at work and then behave as if nothing happened. It's just work, nothing personal.

If you are in your first year in code, one of the first, most important things you have to do is start to develop a thick skin.

That means you have to be able to go into work, even if your performance isn't perfect, even if sometimes you don't completely understand what you are doing (or if you thought you did but in the end everything went wrong). At the same time, don't forget to appreciate yourself and your progress (which may be noticeable only to you), regardless of what happens.

Here are three more ideas for women on developing a thick skin:

#### 1. Cut down your contact with abusive people
 
If your direct manager or team members are just plain unbearable and always trying to bring you down with their obsessive words or actions, then start looking to join a different team or switch jobs. You won't be able to stand this atmosphere for long and it can ruin your self-esteem and confidence.

#### 2. Don't let harsh words hurt you

Sometimes we care too much about what others think.

This especially happens if you are the only woman on a team and worry about the image you are portraying to others. If someone insults you or insists on something you completely disagree with, it keeps repeating in your head over and over because we're taught to deal with that stuff head-on.

The best way to handle this situation is to replace the thought with a more positive one. Why should someone's negative words ruin your day?

Focus on yourself in this situation. Don't let the hurtful words of others make your day worse and take control of your mind. Think positively, cheer yourself up, surround yourself with optimistic and supportive people.

#### 3. Use your words instead of your feelings

If someone is trying to wound your feelings, for example with passive-aggressive feedback, turn their words around and engage with the offender in constructive dialogue.

Don't forget you are allowed to interrupt and say: "Okay. I get it. There's a problem here. You have explained it very clearly. Can we talk about how to fix it? That's more helpful for both of us."

Overall, you are better off being a person who cares too much than a person who doesn't care at all. With luck, these sorts of workarounds can help provide cushions so that criticism doesn't hurt you too much.

### Breaking stereotypes: educate men at work

I can imagine what it means for you to join a new dev team and be the only woman there---because I did it, three times. We're always being "welcomed" with the stereotypes. There is a general impression that men are better at "tech things," that they're more systematic and nuanced, and that on the other hand, women are more intuitive and better communicators, but their judgment isn't as solid.

A friend of mine works at the same digital media agency I used to work at. We often share our experiences and observations from working with each other. Once she told me, "You know, today when I was in a meeting about the project I'm working on, I sat at the table and said something. My team, all men, ignored my comment. Then I noticed whenever the male backend engineer spoke, everyone just stopped and listened. And I thought, that's what I want. I want people to take me seriously and respect my work."

Here's what she did next: she changed her job and started working for a company that values diversity. Now half of her engineering team is women. There she continues to work hard, learn new things and grow professionally. Based on my own experience, if you're new in the industry, the expectations placed on you can be burdensome. But if you're willing to work hard and understand that your first job probably won't be your dream job then it gets easier.

I firmly believe in diversity at work, not only of gender but also of experience level. For example, I believe in creating junior developer positions and training those juniors up. When they are fully integrated into the company, junior developers become loyal employees. By comparison, companies that only hire the most senior developers find that they often already have their own vision of how things have to work, which can be unproductive.

My friend's way worked for her, but she could have done it differently---break stereotypes, that is---by working to bring diversity to her former workplace. The following principles can help you do that.

#### Become an expert in a specific technology/approach and start advocating it

Currently my official title in the workplace is "Frontend Software Engineer." In my opinion, you can't be an expert front end developer just by knowing one thing. An expert developer is not necessarily skilled in any specific set of technologies; instead, they demonstrate the ability to learn new languages, frameworks and libraries as the need arises. The more they learn, the more they can compare and make informed decisions about what tech to pick and when.

Know the requirements of each situation. Don't be afraid of meeting a new challenge, even if you haven't solved that problem before. The more "unknown" things you learn and apply, the more your expertise will grow.

If you are fascinated by a technology, you can start to advocate it. Convince others to try it and use it. It will help you grow your credibility and break false stereotypes about women.

#### Increase your network of women and bring women engineers to the company

If you feel bad working on a team that's all men, what's stopping you from bringing a new woman colleague to your team?

Finding a woman developer is easier than it seems. You can start going to local meetups, volunteering at coding schools, joining university groups, and visiting other local tech events.
 
Companies are always passively looking for new people. It's normal for some people to leave the company and others to join, and someone will grow to the next level professionally and free up a junior position.

#### Help onboard new employees

This is the best way to learn and understand a project more deeply. Keep in mind that if you're a software developer at a product company, it's important to write clean and readable code so that even an intern can understand it---and by the way, you too, in case you return to that code in a week, a month or a year.

I want to talk about the mentor/mentee relationship, which isn't always strictly business. You can develop some real friendships when you take the time to advise someone and help them succeed.

When you develop a relationship with someone over time---when you help them, coach them, and guide them---that person's success is tied to you. Time after time, success will come back to you as the mentor.

Also, your protege can teach you from their own unique experiences and perspective, which may be very different from yours. They may also have new skills they can teach you. 

People never forget their mentors.

Think back to when you first started working at your company. Wouldn't it have been nice to get some coaching from someone who had already been through that process?

#### Build trusting and professional relationships with colleagues and managers

In a company which incorporates people from diverse backgrounds into its network, each person has to trust the others to help them accomplish their own goals and the collective goal of the company.

That's why it's crucial to build trust within teams. It's a long process; it doesn't happen overnight.

The most likable and trustworthy people know that it's not worth offending people by expressing everything they know, even if they are correct. They're good listeners when someone else is talking.

It's also important to show empathy for your colleagues and keep an open mind. Do not judge---try to understand. Those who close themselves off from others' ideas are missing out not only on personal growth but also on opportunities for advancing their career.

People are different, and depending on the situation we may express ourselves differently, sometimes too emotionally. Try to learn how to maintain professional behavior in all circumstances. Overreacting to things, either positively or negatively, will make a poor impression. Always remember that silence may be much more useful than angry words.

Women in code are driven. We want to prove ourselves. We want to work hard and grow, and it's impossible to buy that kind of enthusiasm.

In parting, I'd like to say: be the change you wish to see in our industry!

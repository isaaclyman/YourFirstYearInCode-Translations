# Burnout, part 1

_James Turner_

_Editor's Note: Burnout is so pervasive and harmful in tech that I've chosen to include two perspectives on it. Programmers burn out for a lot of different reasons and you will either witness it or experience it yourself at some point. When that happens, take some advice from these authors and make a change._

You may have heard the phrase "burnout" before. I can assure you that in this context it has nothing
to do with cars laying down rubber.

Occupational burnout is a feeling of exhaustion, where what you previously enjoyed working on
becomes less enjoyable, where things get on your nerves more easily or even where you have
feelings of depression. One of the first uses of the phrase dates back as far back as 1974 when
psychologist Herbert Freudenberger used the term in one of his published works.

At the end of 2014, I had the opportunity to take on more responsibilities where I worked, being
promoted from a Web Developer to an Account Manager. While I was still programming, my
new responsibilities included liaising with clients, discussing business requirements as well as
managing current and upcoming projects. It was a great experience and I am grateful to have had that
opportunity, but it wasn't without its problems.

I may not have been the "cool" or "fun" person in the office, but I'd say I was the "brains trust"---there 
wasn't a problem I wouldn't try to help solve and most of the time I was successful. I may not
have even known anything about the topic beforehand but if someone asked me a question, I would
as quickly as possible research the topic to work out the answer. This eagerness to help my
colleagues, while an admirable trait, was one part of my problem. It took time to be thorough and I
didn't want my colleagues to struggle on something that I could help them with.

I didn't just want to avoid disappointing my colleagues, I didn't want to disappoint my boss---I had
been given this great opportunity and trusted to do it well. I am a good programmer, and one day I'd
like to think I'll be a good boss, but some of the traits that make me a good developer didn't transfer as
well to this role as I hoped. Larger projects were coming in on top of the business-as-usual work
which led to work piling up. I was in meetings every other day, constantly liaising with clients and
managing projects while also still programming. Rather than tell anyone that I was struggling, I
decided I'd just work a few extra hours that week to make sure everything was done. Those few extra
hours in a week turned into a few extra hours each day till it even got as bad as working an
additional day on top of those extra hours.

While no one asked me to do those extra hours and I didn't even want to do them, I still did them
because I believed it was just a short-term thing that would blow over soon. I was tired, I was
stressed, and every morning I didn't even want to go to work yet the problems that led me here
were so simple.

In mid-2015 the stress peaked and my colleagues were starting to take notice. Two of my
colleagues took me out to lunch to see how I was doing. They asked me if I was okay, knowing
something was going on, and I said no, I wanted to quit. I talked through what was happening with
them, they understood the issues and were sympathetic. They gave suggestions on how to make my
workload easier, helping me with anything I needed. Over the next few months, things were a little
easier and I stopped pushing myself as hard to please everyone.

It took just over 6 months to go from an employee happy to come to work to one who
dreaded it because I couldn't stand the thought of disappointing others. It took a single lunch out for
me to admit how far I had gone and start the journey back to a happier me.

Identifying burnout from the point of view of the person experiencing it is hard---how do you know
if the stress you're feeling about a situation is burnout or not? Burnout, however, isn't black and white;
it is many shades of grey. Burnout may reach a tipping point but that is not a useful measure to
help prevent burnout in the future. With how the feelings of burnout can gradually build up, you
need to look at your own long-term trends in your life. From your mood, to sleep patterns, to diet,
to participation in social gatherings---these can all help indicate whether something is changing in
your life.

One of the more obvious indicators for me should have been realising that I didn't want to go to
work when I woke up in the morning. While this feeling might happen for a lot of different reasons,
it is an indication that something is up in your life and it is best to evaluate what that might be.

Determining the cause for such feelings is incredibly important in trying to address them.
When trying to identify the cause, it is best to keep an open-minded approach as it really can be
from things you didn't even realise. The causes that lead to burnout don't even need to be exclusive
to your job, they can be events in your personal life or social circles.

The causes leading to my burnout came from my actions at my job, not from my personal life and
not from expectations by my colleagues or boss. I chose to accept the opportunity to take on more
responsibilities and I chose to work extra hard to make sure I would succeed. This may seem like I
am trying to carry the burden for the situation, but I don't blame myself for burning out.
Instead, I take responsibility for the fact that my own actions allowed stress to build up.

Although I can say that about my situation, it doesn't necessarily mean that your feelings of
burnout are caused by you. You may not be remotely the cause of the feelings; you are only
responsible for how you handle those feelings and what you are going to do about them.

The most appropriate action for handling burnout will vary widely depending on the cause. With
that being said, the one thing you can always do to help your state of mind is to talk to someone
about the situation. It may be best that this person is not involved in what you believe are the
causes, but the key here is that you are talking about it at all. The reason I see this being effective is
the same reason Rubber Duck Debugging (see Appendix A, "Rubber Ducking") is effective: when you talk through a problem aloud it can
help you have a deeper understanding of it, leading to ways to resolve it.

When you are on the path to resolving your feelings of burnout, I think it is important to consider
what you want your future self to be. Of course you want to be happy and healthy but is it at the
same job? Are you wanting to stay in this industry? Do you see yourself living in the same location or having the
same friends? These questions might seem dramatic, but dramatic changes might be what you
need. The decisions you make here are wholly your own and it is important to weigh
everything in perspective to your own life.

If your causes are primarily job-related, it might be enough to try and move to a different team or
department. For situations where you see no resolution at your workplace, speaking with your feet
and finding a different job is the most powerful action. If your causes are primarily social life
related, work out what specific things you could do to have a positive impact. Maybe at
the end of the day, you may only need a break to do something else---only you will know if that is
what is best for you.

When you have resolved your current feelings of burnout, it is important to stay vigilant as they can
always creep back. Look after yourself; you only live once.

What if you're not the person experiencing burnout, but you want to make sure anyone you
know or work with isn't having issues? While you can potentially identify it through a decrease in
work performance or long-term changes in mood, it can be as simple as asking if they are okay. I
wouldn't recommend doing it over a Slack message or in front of a group of people but if you can
have a one-on-one conversation with them, don't hesitate to ask. Asking someone that question
may be exactly what they are needing to hear, genuine support from a friend or colleague so they
can evaluate themselves and their situation.

At the end of the day, while burnout can be a serious topic, it isn't an impossible problem to
resolve and isn't something you need to handle alone.

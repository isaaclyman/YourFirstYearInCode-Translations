# Different learning pathways into tech

_Clifford Fajardo_

There are many industries (law, medicine, etc.) where a formal credential is required before you begin work in the field. By contrast, the software development field, like many creative fields (business, art, etc.), does not require that you have a formal credential to start working in the field. Given this fact, there are different learning pathways you can take to reach your goal of becoming a professional software developer.

In the pages that follow, I'll outline the learning path I took to become a professional software developer. I'll start off by sharing how I began programming, then cover my self-learning path, coding bootcamp path, and university path, then circle back to the self-learning path I'm on now. My aim is to shed light on the thought process I used to inform which learning path to embark on, based on my circumstances, and ultimately demonstrate that there are several paths you can choose.

### The night I discovered code

It was mid-December. I had just finished a semester of classes at my community college, and now I had two weeks of vacation before the beginning of the new year. On one of these evenings, while browsing the web as usual, I discovered a free learn-to-code website called codecademy.com. A few short minutes into using the site, I made a blue box with HTML and CSS. A few minutes later I made an alert box pop up on my screen with the message, "Hello Clifford." I was astonished that I had just made my computer bring an idea to life before my eyes. Thus began my journey into the world of software development and teaching myself how to code.

### The path of self-learning

After discovering codecademy.com, I continued learning the fundamentals of web development whenever I had free time after work or class.

In 2016, halfway through my second year of college, I had been teaching myself to code for almost a year. At that point I became curious about this hobby of coding I had picked up and naively started doing research online to see if programming was something I could do full time as a job. To my surprise it was, and in my research I stumbled upon some coding bootcamps. I found out that this was an alternative learning path to a traditional college degree.

After this discovery, I started following the blogs of several bootcamps and the blogs of their students who were sharing their experiences. Despite the excitement I had about bootcamps at the time, I continued teaching myself web programming, kept the idea of attending a bootcamp as a possibility in the back of my mind, and continued through college.

### My decision between college and a coding bootcamp

When April 2016 came around, I had completed my general education requirements at community college and my college transfer letters came in. I was fortunate enough to receive full scholarships to study Sociology at UC Berkeley and many other flagship state colleges. Despite this accomplishment, I knew deep down that I wanted to pursue computer programming. More specifically, I knew front-end software engineering was what I enjoyed and wanted to focus on.

I had a decision to make. I was conflicted about which path to take so I asked myself: Do you want to spend two more years as a transfer student to complete the remaining half of your undergraduate degree, studying something you're no longer enthusiastic about? Or would it be better to pursue your dream now and maximize your personal growth and development?

I decided to make a seemingly risky but nonetheless well-calculated decision based on my circumstances: to put my formal education on hold and do the Hack Reactor coding bootcamp, an immersive 12-week course. Choosing Hack Reactor, I would later come to realize, was one of the best decisions I had ever made in my life.

### Why I chose a bootcamp

The bootcamp approach made the most of my circumstances. I didn't want to switch majors and be in a classroom for another four years, despite having had a fantastic experience in college. Instead, I felt I could be gaining years of work experience, problem-solving skills, and personal growth, all while getting paid to learn and earning income for my family.

I considered continuing on the self-learning pathway. However, I felt I could accelerate my learning by being around other highly motivated peers and following a rigorous curriculum, which I probably wouldn't have had the courage to tackle alone at that time. Ultimately I wanted to obtain a high degree of competency quicker, in a more structured environment, and kickstart my career.

Truthfully, another major factor that influenced my decision was the fact that I was tired of struggling financially and living under the poverty line. I was tired of seeing my twin brother and my parents, a janitor and a physically disabled stay-at-home mom, under financial strain. If I had chosen to go major in computer science given my circumstances, I would still be finishing my last year of college right now and my family would still be struggling, which is no longer the case.

Though I did have to combat thoughts about being a "dropout," I believed I could break into the software industry. Market conditions in my area were favorable (they generally still are across the United States) and there was plenty of evidence and testimony that I could start a fantastic career as a software developer without a degree, since thousands of other bootcamp graduates had done so before me.

> "Why didn't you just change your major to computer science (CS) at community college?"

Changing my major to CS would have meant staying another 2 - 2.5 more years at my community college and taking several classes merely to complete prerequisites so I could qualify for the CS major at the universities I was applying to.

Another consideration was that all of the colleges I was applying to transfer to didn't offer a curriculum covering the topics I was most interested in. I wanted to take courses where I could learn about web applications, JavaScript and NodeJS, front-end web development, and responsive design.

> "Why didn't you change your major to computer science (CS) at the four-year university, UC Berkeley?"

I wouldn't have been able to switch my major to CS without taking all the pre-requisite classes for the major. Again, that would have meant two more years of classes just to qualify for the major. On top of that, after qualifying, I would need another two years' worth of upper division credits to graduate. This meant it would take me four more years of school before obtaining a degree and my first full-time entry-level job. The idea of spending four more years in large classrooms worrying about my grades and studying a wide array of topics that weren't immediately relevant to my goals didn't resonate with me.

In summary, I chose the bootcamp for three main reasons: (1) To get to my goal sooner by being in a structured, immersive learning environment; (2) To support my family; and (3) To study the areas of software development that I wanted, which weren't offered at colleges in my area.

After beginning my career as a software engineer at Salesforce in San Francisco, I attended a semester at UC Berkeley as a working student and took one of their most popular computer sciences classes. I had the opportunity to experience what it was like to study computer science in a college setting, and it validated what I felt previously. I preferred learning environments where I had more flexibility to choose what to learn and where I didn't need to worry about grades. Although the college path wasn't for me, for many people the college path is excellent and offers a lot of value.

### A high-level overview of coding bootcamps

Coding bootcamps are immersive technical coding schools that teach the essential programming skills and technologies that employers seek.

In terms of curriculum and learning structure, not all bootcamps are the same. Some are in-person, others are online; the majority require a full-time commitment while others are part-time. The goals and curriculum of each coding bootcamp may be different as well. For example, there are bootcamps that focus on mobile development, data science, machine learning, full-stack web development, and so on.

A few more considerations about bootcamps are:

- Instruction: There are bootcamps that help people with very little or almost no coding experience get to a job-ready stage. In contrast, some coding bootcamps require candidates to have a minimum of a few months of self-study experience and meet a specific technical bar via an admissions test. Most coding bootcamps require admitted students to complete pre-course material before starting the program. This ensures every student is beginning with nearly the same baseline knowledge and helps maximize the content that can be covered in the program's few months.
  
- Quality: Generally, the more rigorous the admissions standards are, the higher the quality of instruction, curriculum, students, alumni network and job success outcomes.
  
- Alumni networks: Generally, the longer a bootcamp has been around, the more alumni you have access to. For example, I'm part of an alumni network of several thousand graduates who are working across nearly every subset of the software development industry. As a new graduate or an experienced alumnus, this may be helpful since you have a large pool of people you can connect with.
  
- Price: The tuition varies for each bootcamp. Many programs allow you to put down a small down payment (or nothing at all) and pay back the rest of the program fee once you secure a job as a software developer.
  
- The job hunt after the program: Similar to colleges that may have a career center to help guide and support students in their job hunt, most bootcamps offer that as well. It's important to note that if you are coming into a bootcamp with the expectation that a job will be handed to you after you graduate or that it's the bootcamp's responsibility to find you jobs, that's not the reality. You should leverage all of the resources that your bootcamp has to offer to maximize your odds.
  
- How long it takes to obtain a job: Some of your peers will find jobs much faster than others, due to varying circumstances. For example, it took me two and a half months of studying and job hunting every day to secure my first software developer job, but it may be different for you.

I want to highlight that bootcamps are not for everyone. It's essential to evaluate your own goals and learning style and make the choice that meets your needs best.

### The cost of forsaking a computer science degree

It's important to briefly address a few points concerning the cost of forsaking a computer science degree, as to avoid any surprises:

* You will be competing for the same jobs that computer science graduates are applying for. You will need to work hard to demonstrate that you have what it takes to do the job and have the ability to fill any knowledge gaps for a role.

* It may be harder to initially demonstrate to employers the value you bring without a formal credential. However, do not be discouraged. The good news is many (perhaps most) employers nowadays have progressive hiring practices and will consider anyone who has the skills required for the role and who they feel is a good match.

* Some jobs and employers require a computer science degree, which is fair given that every employer has different needs.

* Often, as a bootcamper or self-learner, you won't get the broad exposure to software (operating systems, compilers, distributed systems, etc.) that most computer science graduates obtain. Some may doubt the importance of this; however, no one can dispute that knowing more about what exists and what tools are available to you is beneficial. Of course, you can always fill in gaps in knowledge if you're deliberate about your learning.

### Differences between bootcamps, colleges and self-taught pathways

Below is a brief overview of the differences and similarities between the different learning paths discussed in this chapter. At the end of this chapter, additional resources are provided for those who would like more information.

**Time Commitment**

* Bootcamp: 3-9 months; varies depending on the bootcamp.

* College: 4 years; varies depending on the college or individual.

* Self-Taught: varies depending on the individual and whether they are studying part-time or full-time. Some people qualify for a development job in a few months, others may take several months and others a year or more.

**Financial Cost**

* Bootcamp: Varies depending on the reputation and duration of the program. Most immersive bootcamps range from $9,000 - $20,000 USD.

* College: Varies depending on the college, reputation and duration of the program. According to a 2019 statistical report on the average cost of a 4-year college in the United States:
    * Public 4-year college: ~$20,000 / year (assuming no financial aid or help at all). Subtract ~$11,000 if you are living at home.
    * Private 4-year college: ~$46,950 / year. Subtract ~$11,000 if you are living at home.

* Self-Taught: Cost varies depending on the courses and resources you purchase. It's possible to obtain most or all of the information you need for free, online or with a library card. Some libraries have partnerships with paid services (e.g. Treehouse or LinkedIn Learning).

**Learning Curriculum**

* Bootcamp: Shorter length programs (~12 weeks) focus on a very specialized curriculum to help students develop expertise in only a few technologies. This tradeoff is intentional, as most bootcamps assume and trust that their graduates will continue learning the necessary skills they need throughout their career. Longer programs, like the Lambda School which is 9 months long, not only teach highly marketable technologies but also do their best to bridge the gap between the exposure computer science majors typically obtain and what shorter bootcamps often don't cover.

* College: Given that there is more time to cover material, computer science graduates tend to have a much broader view of the entire field of programming, especially when it comes to theory. As one computer science graduate, Christian Charukiewicz, puts it: 

> _Personally, as someone who has just finished their CS degree, I can tell you that I feel like my learning has only begun. I think one of the most valuable aspects of my degree is that it has lifted many of the "unknown unknowns" and turned them into "known unknowns." That means I may not be an expert in compilers, or system programming, or CS theory, or any of the topics I studied in college. However, I know that they are out there, and I know what most of them are so that I can research them and hone my skills as needed as my career progresses._

* Self-Taught: With freedom comes a great deal of responsibility. You will need to dedicate lots of time to curating your own learning material and continuously evaluate the quality of the resources you are consuming, as opposed to a college student or bootcamper who is following a structured learning curriculum. For the highly dedicated learner, being in complete control of one's education can be a source of great satisfaction. On the flip side, it's easier to consciously or unconsciously neglect learning topics that may be essential for your growth, since there is less guidance. You don't know what you don't know.

**Networking and Cultural Growth**

* Bootcamp: The majority of my peers already had years of professional experience and degrees in other industries, as many bootcampers are transitioning between careers. Bootcampers can leverage their past experience to help them obtain new opportunities in the software field. For example, I have a friend who was a DJ/audio engineer before becoming a programmer. He went on to work for a music streaming company after bootcamp.

* College: Typically younger aged peers, 18-25, without full-time work experience. Colleges usually offer internships, volunteer opportunities, and projects for students to gain practical experience.

* Self-Taught: There's no built-in network when you're self-taught, so you'll need to rely on jobs, meetups, conferences, open-source projects, social media, and other self-driven forms of outreach in order to build your network.

### Similarities: bootcamps & college

**Networking and Cultural Growth**

* Your peers, instructors and alumni network are easily accessible since you typically see them daily. This translates into having people close by to quickly learn and expand your worldview from, not just in programming.

**Job Support**

* Nearly all bootcamps and colleges have a career or job resources center for students and alumni; they have a vested interest in your success. After all, what institution wouldn't want to showcase their graduates succeeding?

**Learning Curriculum**

* The material you are learning has been evaluated and selected by others. Thus, you can spend your energy on learning, instead of hand-curating your learning resources.

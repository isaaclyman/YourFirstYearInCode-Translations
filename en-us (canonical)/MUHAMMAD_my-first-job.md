# My first job

_Muhammad Arslan Aslam_

My first job was at a small tech firm as a Junior Front End Developer. The salary was low, but I was desperately needy and eager to get into the industry, learn, and work. I didn't care about anything in the contract. They asked me when I could join, and I went straight to the office the very next day.

I learned a lot there about many things. Design. User experience. Development. WordPress. It was a good journey for a couple of months until they started asking me to stay late. I knew that on rare occasions, if a project was past the deadline or close to it, putting in some extra hours to complete it wasn't gonna hurt. But an extra 5-6 unpaid hours per day? That was a lot to ask for, considering I wasn't even getting paid as much as the average intern.

I left the company after one year and they never paid me my last month's salary.

A month later I got another job offer. This time I asked about company policies regarding overtime, medical expenses, staying late, etc.

It worked very well for a few months but then it was the same story all over again. The manager would force me to stay late and would even say he wasn't going to let me leave until I was finished. I'd get late night calls to get up and do something because the person who was responsible for it wasn't picking up the call. I would work from midnight until 8AM and couldn't be late for work afterward.

I actually blogged about it when I was getting frustrated with the situation and got a lot of feedback from the community, including senior developers, which helped me a lot. Right after I published that post and heard people's advice, I decided to quit the job. I stood up for myself and told my manager that putting in so many extra hours was affecting my personal life and I had started to get depressed.

It felt like a prison (not that I've been to prison, but still). You know how you can sit in your room watching Netflix all day and it doesn't bother you, but if someone _orders_ you to sit in your room and watch Netflix all day, it becomes an awful chore.

I was worried at first about leaving the job. I was getting good money and the medical insurance was a good thing (more or less) but I gained the courage to leave the job and move on.

There are a lot of things that happened as a beginner that I feel a little ashamed to share. I should've stood up for myself right then but I didn't. I thought I might not get another job. But fortunately for me, everything worked out.

I have a stable job now which pays me well. The hours are flexible and the work environment is great. Learning opportunities are abundant plus I get to work with people who are much more experienced than I am and everyone here is eager to teach.

To summarize a few things that I learned from all of these experiences: 

- When signing a contract at your first job (or any job as matter of fact), read it carefully. Ask about the company's policies regarding different aspects of normal everyday work. The ideal would be if you could get some legal advice on it. If that's not possible, just ask someone who has been through the same process, a friend or family member. Be careful about what you sign.
- Stand up for yourself when there's an issue. If you "let it pass this one time," it's gonna stick forever. I ignored my boss being abusive once and he continued being abusive for the rest of my time there. Don't let that happen to you. 
- In the tech industry, occasionally putting in extra hours to meet deadlines isn't necessarily a big deal. People do it a lot, some times more than others. But make sure it's not because of someone's ego. I was asked to stay late because my boss "just felt like it". That's over the line. Never settle for this kind of behavior.
- Know your rights. Workplace toxicity can affect your personal life and mental health. Unfortunately, in many Asian countries, management doesn't pay much attention to this serious issue. If you're not feeling well, you can't work properly. Workplace toxicity comes in many different forms. If you feel like you are suffering harassment from a co-worker, a manager or anyone else, contact the people in charge. If they don't do anything about it, reach out to other organizations or the authorities. Someone else at your company might be facing the same issue. Stand up for yourself and others too.
- Last but not least, _know your worth, and never settle for less_.

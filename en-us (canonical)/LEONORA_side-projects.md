# Make the most of side projects

_Leonóra Dér_

This chapter will be about side projects and I would like to convince all of you that they are great!

So what comes to your mind when I say "side projects"?

Maybe you know of CommitStrip. It's a blog about the daily life of developers and I just love reading their stuff, but one of [my favorite strips](http://www.commitstrip.com/en/2014/11/25/west-side-project-story/) from them is about side projects. It shows a very typical situation: a developer having millions of unfinished, never-going-to-end projects. Have you ever felt like this? Not yet?

In some ways I'm writing to motivate you to do this. To start new side projects. To also finish them, of course, but to be able to finish one, first you have to start it! But why would anyone want to do that?

### Famous examples

To get an idea of what side projects really are, first check out a few famous ones. I guess I have to start with a couple of the most famous side projects, Gmail and AdSense. Both were created by enthusiastic Googlers.

Twitter, ProductHunt and even GitHub were once side projects. And the list of side projects that became million-dollar startups goes on...

### My projects

But don't tune out just yet! You might think that I'm crazy about side projects and the truth is, I am. I'd like to show you a few of my own side projects so you can see how they've helped me. I picked very different ones:

The very first of my side projects was an online tool where you could create, edit, and share a business model. I used this project as an opportunity to learn Vue.js (a web framework) and Spring Boot (a Java server framework). Now, I've struggled to find users, but I recently made some progress: I spoke with a startup incubator who said they would love to use it! I'm more than happy with that. If you'd like to take a look, you can [find it online](http://businessmodelcanvas.io)! 

My current project is a challenge for developers. It will be a collection of challenges soon, but at the moment there is only one. It's called the Cretan Maze. You're trapped in a maze and have to get out, but you have to collect three gold coins first and you control the game through a REST API. So as a developer you have to write a program to find your way out of the maze. I shared it on a few sites when I finished coding it. To tell the truth, it was a bit like testing in production. I mean...I checked the functions, everything was working properly more or less, but when a lot of people started to use it, bugs came out immediately. So I learned that I should conduct a beta test before I let everyone in through the front door. Anyway, you can try your hand at the challenge [here](https://coding-challanges.herokuapp.com/challanges/maze).

Last but not least, the project I am most proud of is my blog. It's a blog for software developers, written in Hungarian. It is called 'fejlesztő lány' and I started it as a personal challenge; I needed something in my life I would have to spend at least 10-20 minutes with daily so I can keep track of the days. It might sound a bit weird, but sometimes I lose track of time. This blog and Facebook have helped me a lot and I know it's not a traditional side project, but I truly recommend to any developer to start a blog!

### Cons

Now that we have an idea of what a side project can be, let's ask an obvious question: Why would anyone want to spend time on a side project?

I mean, you might say that you don't have time. I guess most of you have full-time jobs. You could say that after working for eight hours you are tired and you don't care at all. Or you have a family you would prefer to spend time with, and on the weekends you want to be far away from the keyboard, hiking in the mountains or playing on your local football team.

But remember, people say that you have time for what you make time for. I know it's a cliche but it is very true. Once I read a post by a dad who learned how to program in the evenings, and couldn't even sleep much as he had a newborn daughter to look after, but a few months later he got his very first developer job.

Think about that for a second. He put his time into it and he got a reward: a job offer. Sounds great, doesn't it? 

You might also say that side projects are something that no one pays for, and no one will praise you for the effort and time you put into a side project if you fail or abandon it. The bitter truth is, undoubtedly, most side projects will fail. We all know this. The majority of them don't even reach the first release, and those that do often become abandonware, no longer supported by the developer. GitHub is a graveyard for them.

You could also say that it's useless to spend time on this stuff, creating another note-taking app, an alternative to one used by millions or billions of people, whatever for? 

### Pros

Let me show you all the advantages!

The first advantage I'd like to emphasize is learning new technologies and dev skills. 

For example, if you're a Java coder, why not try Python with a data science side project? Or if you're a backend developer, why don't you try out a shiny new frontend framework? Or let's say you usually do coding stuff, but deploying your own app to Heroku and setting up a database, Jenkins jobs, or code analysis with SonarQube could be a challenge for you! 

We live in a world with constantly changing technologies. So if you want to keep up with the new trends, the best tool for the job is side projects, making some useless or not-so-useless projects to try out a new library, framework or tool.

Instead of staying updated on the latest frontend frameworks in the JavaScript universe, you could also have a project focused on learning how to write clean code, how to refactor legacy code, or how to do Test-Driven Development, because these things take a lot of time to master. You could try reading a well-known book on the topic and implementing the knowledge at the same time.

Another great benefit of side projects is that you are practising outside of your office hours. If you use the same technologies at work and for your hobby projects, you'll meet the most typical bugs and pitfalls beforehand so that you can feel more confident at work. You'll get to know the best practices, so you can help others make better decisions or give advice on using library A rather than library B, saving time for you and money for your company.

The next advantage I'd like to mention here is simply the joy of building something. It's fulfilling when you can show your product to others, or take a look at something and know you're the one that created it. You should be proud of yourself if you've completed a project that others can use or download. The feeling when other people are happily using your product is quite satisfying.

And there's another skill that you can build using your old side projects: refactoring. Think about it as working on legacy code that you have to make work by turning buggy, vulnerable code into something beautiful, making changes line by line, starting small but making powerful improvements in the long run.

Side projects are also great because they look great on your CV or resume. During the interview, when they ask about projects you've worked on, you'll be happily saying that you did this, that and some other stuff too. They help build your online presence and that certainly won't do any harm to your CV, career, network, or professional growth either.

If one of your projects gets serious then you can even quit your job, start a business, and become an entrepreneur. I'm not encouraging you to quit your job right now, but it might happen...

A friend of mine always says that a good side project makes you money while you sleep. But sometimes that mentality can do harm, as some people get very anxious when their projects start to make even a little money. Generally, the primary goal is not to make money, but to learn, to advance, to grow.

I have a few more advantages of side projects to share with you. For example, if you collaborate on an open source project or build something for a community, then you will be able to connect with developers from all around the world and make some new friends and connections. That sounds good, doesn't it?

Also, it's refreshing. It's a great way to get out of your comfort zone and do something different from your day job.

Last but not least, I would say that it's FUN! Think about it! You have the freedom to do whatever you want---there's no boss or client to tell you what to do and how to do it! You don't have to spend hours in useless meetings. You don't have to convince anybody of your own point of view. Your code will be super consistent and strictly follow all the best code conventions: yours.

### How

Now that you know all the advantages and disadvantages of side projects, I would like to give you some advice on how to get the most of the time you're willing to spend on them.

#### Step 1: Find a topic

Usually when I want to learn a new technology, I build something. Getting your hands dirty is the only way of actually making sure that you got it right. You need those "aha!" moments you can't have just by reading or watching tutorials. A lot of people build "To Do List" apps, which are nice because they're easy to get started with and everyone is familiar with them. But I personally don't want to make yet another To Do app! If I'm going to spend my super precious time on something, I want to be making something that has a chance of creating value for someone. For me it's best to make something useful, but of course sometimes it's nice to do something just for fun.

Another suggestion: use a note-taking app. Ideas can come anytime, so be prepared! Otherwise you will forget them.

If you are clueless as to what to do, you can find millions of ideas on the internet!

#### Step 2: Make a plan

Don't worry, I'm not saying that you should start by writing a detailed, 100-page document. I'd guess you're used to that because of your day job. Your plan can be a random text file a few lines long, with core features, goals and milestones. It's usually useful to make separate files for the first version of the project and for changes, new features, etc. And don't forget to limit the scope and set a deadline!

#### Step 3: Find a community

You can find online forums and groups that are made for sharing and receiving constructive feedback on side projects. One of my favorites is the [r/SideProject subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/). It's very active and well-moderated and you can even get some new ideas from there or use it for brainstorming.

#### Step 4: Build something minimal, and I mean minimal

Believe me: even if you are an experienced developer, chances are that you're going to overestimate your own capacity. It's common to feel like you're more productive alone than you are inside your organization, and this is true to a certain extent. But if you don't keep your feature list short enough, chances are that you won't finish the project before you lose your motivation and interest.

#### Step 5: Become a finisher!

Despite your best intentions, things will come up. You'll always have good reasons not to finish a project, like going on holiday, taking German lessons, or reading funny stuff on the internet. But sometimes you have to say to yourself, "Hey, you are going to finish this app and put it on the Android app store. It doesn't matter how long it takes, you are going to work on this app at least an hour each day until it's done." 

#### Step 6: Go live!

Going live isn't just about publishing your app to the app store or deploying your website to the web. It can be publishing a library to npm or even just open sourcing the code so people can see it, use it and learn from it. Don't forget to spread the word! Post about it on your blog, subreddits, dev communities, even ProductHunt. You will love receiving feedback from your actual users and contributors.

#### Pro Tip 1: Go to hackathons!

Hackathons are getting more popular and more frequently organized as they're a great way to bring people together. You're usually closed up with a few people to work on a project for a while, sometimes up to three or four days. By the end you'll have a team, a detailed concept, even a demo version of a product. Sounds good, doesn't it?

#### Pro Tip 2: Find a supportive workplace

At the company a friend of mine works for, they have an 'Experiment Day' every month. It's great for trying out interesting technologies. Similar ideas are found across a lot of tech companies---and it's easy to see why. You could even be the person who organizes these events.

I've heard that at some companies they have a "Demo Day" where anyone from the company can show what they've been working on in their free time. 

There is also Google's famous "20% policy", which means their employees can work on anything they want for up to 20% of their work time. Why would a company do that? Because they've recognized that it's beneficial for their employees and their company too.

Keep in mind that if you create something using company time or computers, it may legally belong to your employer, so check your contract to make sure you're aware of that possibility.

### So why not start one?

As you can see, your precious time spent working with side projects can be beneficial. Your small ideas can even grow into big companies. I hope that you are all motivated now to start and to finish one! In the end, the most important thing you can do is to grow and gain experience.

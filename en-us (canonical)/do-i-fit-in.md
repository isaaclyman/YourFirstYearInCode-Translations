# Do I fit in?

_Editor's Note: Following are some true stories and advice from developers who have wondered if tech is the right place for them. If you've had the same doubts, I hope their words will encourage you._

### Sabrina's story

_Sabrina Gannon_

Despite coming from what's generally considered a traditional computer science background, "Do I fit in?" is a question I've had to tackle many times in my programming career. The first time I asked myself this question was when I was applying to university for Computer Science, because math was the subject I performed lowest in and English was my highest. The most exposure I had to code came in the form of customizing my Neopets HTML pages; it was just enough to make me curious enough to take the leap and apply anyway.

I thought a University degree would give me a feeling of legitimacy that would put the nagging question "Do I fit in?" to a stop. Instead, the work I did at a very research-focused University, alongside many classmates who had far more coding experience than I did, exacerbated the feeling to the point that I doubted I would even finish my degree, let alone have a sunny employment outlook. 

My first technical full-time role came in the form of an internship the summer after I'd finished my degree; this was the next level of questioning my own sense of belonging and identity. I had moved out of my family's home and across the country, and I was surrounded by smart people and learning about web development, a development specialization I had little to no experience in. It was a whirlwind, and I spent far too much time convinced that my presence there was happenstance.

At the end of that internship, a full time job offer came through. My four month interview had paid off, and what felt surreal became that much more so. This is a moment I come back to often on the more difficult "Do I fit in?" days, because that was one day that I can look to as a source of validation. I definitely recommend collecting these moments to remind yourself when the little voice suggesting you don't belong speaks up, because there will always be moments when it does and being prepared to tell it off never hurts.

Being a woman does not help with managing this feeling; being reminded how rare you are because of your gender in a group project does nothing positive for feelings of imposter syndrome. Nor does the implication that you might get hired to inflate a company's diversity numbers and be a spokesperson for them. These were all said to me casually, as if they were stating the sky is blue, which made them that much easier to internalize.

There will be jerks, and worse, there will be jerks who aren't even self-aware enough to be called jerks.

But in all these steps, I met good people too. People who encouraged me to take a chance on myself when I otherwise would have backed down, people who listened to me unpack the self doubt and negative thoughts that I'd internalized along the way. Without them, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to take the next step. I've been very fortunate to know them, and now am very fortunate to be able to be this person for others as well.

Here's what I've learned time and time again when I'm faced with the question "Do I fit in?":

- A lot of what made me feel excluded was rooted in technical jargon I didn't know and the fact that everyone using it seemed so much smarter than me. 
- Tech is a huge, vast field---no one knows everything, and adaptability is key. Taking the time to figure out how I learn best and continually invest in that development has helped me offset my experiences with imposter syndrome immensely.
- Be patient with yourself!
- Take note of and celebrate little wins and steps forward.
- Keep an ear to the ground on what's going on in the industry, the types of conversations being had. I find Twitter useful for this.
- There are jerks, but there are also good people out there. Don't be afraid of seeking them out; whether through local meetups or online communities, growing your support network really helps you foster a sense of belonging for yourself and others.
- If you are coming from a non traditional background, that is an asset; don't let anyone convince you otherwise. Many of the skills that make me most effective at working with others and communicating with stakeholders were gained working part-time jobs while I was in school.

My own answer to the question "Do I fit in?" is always shifting. I've found the more that you work and engage with others to make a given environment a little warmer and more welcoming, the more you'll find yourself a place to fit into that process, and while tech might have a few characters who seem resistant to this, every day there are more and more people like you---people who have wondered if they fit in---writing their first line of code.

### My software developer journey

_Clifford Fajardo_

At the beginning of 2016, I had just graduated from a coding boot camp, finished a long job search and was starting my career as a software developer at Salesforce in San Francisco. I was excited about the journey ahead and equally very nervous.

I felt as if I had stepped into a whole new world! I was starting my first full-time job; I was now working in a corporate environment; I was working on a fully remote team; I was worried that I didn't fit the typical software developer profile and was concerned about how I would perform on the job.

This new world I had stepped into felt like a long shot from where I had come from. Before this job, I had been a student at community college and the only work experience I had at the time was as a student tour guide and pizza chef.

It was still hard for me to believe that I, a kid from a first generation immigrant family from Nicaragua who had been living on the poverty line for most of his life, was now the first person in his family to work in a corporate environment and the first to become a software developer.

As I transitioned into that role, it felt like I was on a roller coaster ride. There were lots of great high moments and low moments. I would have work days where I would create something or fix a bug and feel complete joy. There were other days where I questioned if this was the right career for me because of how challenging it felt or how long it was taking me to complete my work, relative to my peers.

There was even a point during my first year as a developer when I seriously questioned whether I fit in and belonged in this industry. I almost decided to go back to my old, easier but less fulfilling life, which for me meant not confronting my fears head on and growing from them.

When I had these types of days what helped me push through were the thoughts of my family and the vision I had when I first started to learn to code. The vision that one day I would become knowledgeable enough to build out any idea I could envision and impact the lives of millions of people.

Looking back, I'm so happy I didn't give in to my fears. If I had, I wouldn't have had the opportunity to later work at LinkedIn, my second job, where I worked on apps impacting over half a billion people. I would have missed out on the opportunity to gain the experience, knowledge, and confidence that I needed to eventually venture out and start working full time on the business and app I work on today.

_Everyone is different, own your individuality_

In retrospect, most of the low experiences and feelings I had about not belonging came from not appropriately managing my own expectations, my lack of experience, oftentimes my impatience, and being too hard on myself.

During tough times, it was easy to forget the reality of the situation I was in:

* I'm new to this job and industry, so it absolutely takes time to adjust.
* I'm taking longer than all my peers to complete tasks, but that's normal at any new job or role.
* Just like me, everyone on my team was once new and inexperienced at something.

And equally as easy to forget the things I had control over:

* Though I'm not at the level I want to be at now, I can make a change and take ownership of my learning and growth. It may require some extra time outside of work, but it's doable.
* I don't have to be the same person I was yesterday. I can learn to be a more effective leader, communicator, and developer. Pushing myself out of my comfort zone little by little every day will build my character and confidence.
* I don't have to travel on my journey alone. I can find a mentor or employee resource group and accelerate my learning and growth with the help of others.

Once I started realizing all of these things, all areas of my life quickly and dramatically improved. I no longer spent time thinking about whether or not I fit in, regardless of where I was. I finally internalized that I could carve out my own unique place, co-exist with everyone around me, and bring a different perspective to the table.

Own your unique experiences. Own your individuality and be open-minded. Be ready to learn, unlearn and relearn. Lastly, don't be too hard on yourself.

### LGBT

_Connor Ocampo_

Do you identify as an LGBT person? Are you in the process of applying for jobs? Are you concerned with how you might fit in and want some tips on how to best go about including this information in your application? If yes, then this section is for you.

There are many reasons why someone may want to include these personal details in their application, the most important one being to avoid employment with a company that discriminates. The fact is, discrimination among all kinds of minority groups is still a very real occurrence. Because of this, it's important to safeguard yourself against any potential threat that may happen, be it physical, mental or emotional.

Everyone wants to work for a company where they are accepted and can work comfortably. The good news is, there are steps we can take to ensure this outcome.

In this section, I'll outline what I did to communicate my gender identity and other possible ways to go about including this information. I'll share with you how I went about arranging my portfolio to "wave the flag" and express my gender identity. 

_What I did to be visible_

The first question I asked myself was, "how can I go about this while staying relevant to the application?" There were a couple steps I took to achieve this.

The first was to include one of my trans-related side projects in my portfolio---it was an online transgender and allied apparel company. In 2016, I found myself with a unique opportunity to create something, launch it, and see how the market responded. It was a success, I learned a lot, and I figured it was as good a project (and as relevant) as any to showcase in my portfolio.

This checked off two relevance requirements, one being that it was something I created, and two, it dealt with supporting transgender folks.

Now, I can't tell you how every recruiter felt about this information, but I can tell you that the subject of starting a company itself was a strong and positive talking point. And while I did worry that being so visible might hurt my job prospects, I reasoned with it by telling myself if they didn't accept it, then I'm better off not being in that environment.

If someone reading this was worried about "waving the flag", I'd tell them the same thing. Be strong in your conviction to be yourself. Be unapologetic about it! Anywhere with anyone that stands to discriminate against you isn't a place you want to be. And on a positive note, anywhere with anyone that stands to accept you and welcome you as you are is exactly the place you want to be!

_Leaving more clues_

Another approach I took was including personal details in my about/bio section of my portfolio website. These are more simple and subtle steps you can take to ensure that the company is aware of your identity.

I'm very transparent in mine, openly addressing my gender identity and my belief that it's important for minority groups to be visible. This is a great and appropriate way to be visible!

_Visibility over 9000!_

If you want to raise your visibility beyond those two methods, leave more digital footprints. Blog about LGBT topics that matter to you. These could be published on any digital medium, including your own personal website or on social media in microblog form. Just remember to include links to your social media profiles in your portfolio website if you choose to be visible on them!

If the hiring manager is thorough with vetting their candidates, these thoughtfully sprinkled-in details will surely catch their eye. And if they're a super awesome, diversity-advocating company, they'll have all the more reason to welcome you with open arms.

_During the initial interview_

First, congrats on the interview! You've done great so far. Time to keep going!

At this stage in the interview process, the conversation should be fairly laid back with the recruiter's focus being to get acquainted with you. In my experience, you'll find a lot of opportunities to speak about what you've worked on and what you're proud of so far. The recruiter usually sets the stage for this.

Ideally, it'd be a good idea to bring up two or three pieces of work with either an LGBT project or blog being casually looped in the mix. That way, if for whatever reason the recruiter overlooked that detail in your portfolio, it'd be 100% clear and open now for you to assess how they respond to it.

If they respond negatively, you'll know. I've never had this happen to me. But in case it does, stay cool, be the bigger person, and exit the conversation. We can flip this unfortunate situation and think of it as being one step closer to the right fit. The important thing here is to keep moving.

If they respond positively, you'll know. This has happened 100% of the time for me. In this case, stay cool (while having an internal celebration) and keep the conversation flowing. You'll feel great knowing that you were brave enough to bring it up and you'll be more comfortable and confident in the conversation.

_Wrapping it up_

The question of "Do I fit it?" can be a tough question to face, especially for individuals in historically oppressed minority groups. But take solace in knowing that times have changed and are continuing to change. We've come a long way as a society and you have the opportunity to allow it to keep going just by being open about who you are.

You are a smart, capable, and highly skilled human being deserving of respect. Whether you're lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender, being visible is important in your journey to fitting in with the right team.

I hope this section was able to help you in some way.

Best of luck to you, friend!

P.S. If you want to find an LGBT person like you in the tech industry, I'd search on social media (Twitter and Instagram). There are a lot of advocates present on social media. Of course, you're always welcome to send me a message as well.

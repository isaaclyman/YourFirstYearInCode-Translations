# I got my dream job. Now what?

_Desi Rottman_

When I started my first job in tech, it was as a support team member at a website builder geared toward musicians. My background made me ideal: years of retail and entertainment-industry customer service, HTML and CSS experience with an interest in web design, a music business degree, and the vocabulary to communicate with low-level tech users. I was pumped---a dream job that felt created just for me. I'd never considered that there was a company out there that married my disparate passions, let alone that I could land a job there.

In that position, I was doing a lot of intense troubleshooting for both clients and co-workers while getting comfortable with how the tech industry works and how companies are structured. It was a company with a QA department of one, and though I fell in love with troubleshooting and breaking things, we already had a great employee in that position. I didn't see myself having the opportunity to transition over. A small, awesome company means low turnover, so I didn't really give much thought to if there would be additional positions on the QA team to transition to eventually. But when our new CEO did some restructuring, she promoted the old QA guy to Project Manager, and behold---I had the opportunity to train for my (new) dream job!

Over the course of a career, your dream job can change and shift---and that's a good thing. As you work you'll learn more about the industry you're in and see more facets of it, discovering positions you never knew existed. In tech and dev, things are always changing. There's always something new to learn or a new startup being founded. That's another reason you might have to continually revisit and redefine your "dream job": new positions and new fields are often being created, so your eventual dream job might not even exist today, though your dream company might.

Advancing in your career also opens more opportunities---and once you start to stagnate, even the perfect job can stop feeling perfect. That's a good thing, but it can feel confusing to know how to keep growing and keep going. After all, wasn't this your ideal position? When this happens in technology, we have a unique opportunity to shape and design our dream jobs.

Even if you're not in a place to consider a transition right now, it's beneficial to look around and see what types of positions are open from time to time. Being aware of what else is out there and interests you is important to keep in mind. Being able to clearly recognize the next great fit when you see it can help stave off self-doubt, while staying prepared to apply when opportunities arise can combat impostor syndrome.

### What else is out there?

A great way to start considering what your new "dream job" might be is to review open positions even before you're ready to leave your company or position. Not only does this give you an idea of what new skills or education you can focus on, it can also put new jobs, industries or technologies on your radar. Specialties like Developer Relations and industries like the Internet of Things might not have even been on the map when you started your tech career. As these categories get more popular and more positions are being created, keeping abreast of what companies are looking for lets you tailor your experience to a new, growing industry.

> **Case Study: Accessibility Expert**

> The web has long been developed with mainly able-bodied users in mind. In recent years, accessible development and design have become hot topics and very important for many companies, but as a relatively new priority, many experienced developers weren't focused on it in the past. Lindsey Kopacz of Acquia Professional Services is an Accessibility Expert, and she also teaches others how to make their products more accessible.

Feeling unsure of where to start looking for other things that would interest you? Take a look around at your co-workers. Is your project manager always asking the other dev team members interesting questions about their projects? Is the support team consistently bringing up the same pain point about accessibility? If those kinds of things interest you, keep your eye on them. See if there's an issue you can help the support team fix, or a project you can shadow the PM on. Not only will that open your eyes to another facet of your company's work, it could be something to add to your new dream job resume.

> UX Engineering is a relatively new position that many companies are hiring for. It blends principles of UX/UI design with front-end development, and can really appeal to developers who have a bent toward user experience. Emma Wedekind of LogMeIn blends her past experience in engineering at IBM with her interest in design (which she exhibits in her open source project, Coding Coach) to build accessible design systems and user interfaces.

### How to start preparing

Starting where you are is a good place to prepare. Look at your current company again, and take a look at what your co-workers' backgrounds are. See if anyone in an interesting position is willing to meet with you for coffee, or even an informational interview. Connecting with someone who is already doing what might be your next dream job will help you learn the real nitty-gritty of their position. It's also likely to help your confidence---it's a fairly low-stakes networking opportunity with someone you already share some commonalities with, and that can end up being a boost when you do start going to interviews again.

Social media sites, particularly places like Twitter and StackOverflow, are also excellent places to learn about emerging tech, connect with others in the space, and even find open positions. The same principle applies here---if you see someone doing work that interests you, try to send them a DM and ask some questions about what they do and how they got there.

Keep your resume and portfolio up to date as you continue to learn and grow your skills, putting most of the focus on the tasks you hope to primarily work on in your next dream job. You'll thank yourself for this later when you don't have to try to throw something together at the last minute when the dream job gets posted.

As you continue to build your skills and learn more about technologies or areas you're drawn to, taking on a side project or signing up for a class to further your knowledge in that specialty will also help you get that much closer to the new dream job. If you're not sure what new skills to build, start looking at job descriptions for other positions that interest you. You'll get an idea of what employers are looking for in hires for that position, and you'll have some great experience and project examples to add to your portfolio!

> **Case Study: User Experience Advocate**

> I always knew that advocating for users and keeping our product looking and working well, while providing them the features they're looking for, was where my passion was. What I didn't realize was that this is an actual position that many companies are looking for! By doing research into what other types of opportunities are out there, it's allowing me to tailor my skills and experience so that when I am ready to leave (or get promoted), I'll be confident and ready.

#### More things to consider

As you start to think about what kind of work you might be interested in next, you'll likely start noticing some trends in the job postings. When you see another description that makes your heart soar, take a look at a few things:

- Job Title: Job titles may not say much about the actual position duties, especially in tech---"Rockstar Ninja" or "Smile Engineer" doesn't say very much about the day-to-day. Focus on the responsibilities listed rather than the hip titles.
- Education Requirements: Do they require a computer science degree, or a master's degree? Do they consider experience as an equivalent? If they do have a hard requirement for a degree, and it's not one you already have, consider if you're willing to get that degree or endorsement. (And if they aren't interested in applicants with diverse experience and education, that may be a red flag in itself.) Get in touch with someone who is already in that position and see if that's truly required for the kind of work you want, or if they use it as a screening funnel for applicants. Furthering education is understood as a requirement for advancement these days, and this can help you know where to focus to be ready for the next position.

Maybe the next move in your ideal career is less about the _kind_ of work you're doing, and more about _where_ you're doing it. It's becoming more and more common for "employment goals" to refer to a company rather than a specific position, and that could be something else to consider if you're looking to move on from that first dream job.

- Lifestyle: Another big consideration in sussing out your next dream job is the intangible quality-of-life factor. Maybe you've enjoyed being a full stack developer, but you're feeling maxed out on your career growth and want to make a transition to system administration. Is it worth making a nice six-figure salary if you're required to be on-call 24/7 to fix any issues? Are you willing to sacrifice a big-city salary in order to have a remote position? These are more ethereal issues that aren't going to be nicely laid out in a job posting, so being prepared to know what you will or won't accept from a company can well prepare you.

One last (but no less important) facet to consider here is the culture of a prospective new company. Similar to the lifestyle you'll have, think about what's important to you at work---a kitted-out game room with arcade games and ping pong tables, with weekly happy hours in the break room, but the understanding that you work closer to 50 hours a week? Or would you rather have less fancy "perks," but more flexibility and freedom? Do the employees seem to relish being there beyond 9-5 hours? In an effort to promote diversity and reduce harassment or abuse, codes of conduct are growing in popularity. Does this company have one that reinforces the culture you want to associate with? Another common "perk" for companies is providing philanthropic opportunities---paid days off for volunteering, or matching employee donations to nonprofits. If possible, try connecting with someone at the company you're interested in to get some of your questions about these things answered.

Does that company culture align with your values? If not, maybe it's not actually your dream company. If the company's ethics don't align with your own, you might not be taking pride in your work, which can take a toll mentally.

Keeping these things in mind is important for any job change in your career, but it can also help you really develop your dream job description.

### Exercise

To start evaluating your next move, even if it feels far off, try to take a look every week or two at open positions at your dream company. If you see one that particularly interests you, save it to your computer. Highlight or circle aspects of the job that interest you, and you can update your resume or portfolio using the same wording.

This also helps you to know what parts of the job you wouldn't be interested in---your "dream job" likely has parts that feel very dry to you, and that's important to keep in mind as you continue searching as well.

Keeping up to date and being educated on other current openings and industry growth will make you confident that you'll know when your new dream job pops up, and be ready to land it!
